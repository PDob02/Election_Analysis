## Challenge Overview
This challenge had us looping through a large CSV that recorded the three candidates votes by county. We were able to parse out the winner of the election and the counties with the most votes. This was based in Colorado so Denver had the largest turnout. Congratulations to Diana DeGette for winning the election overwhelmingly.
